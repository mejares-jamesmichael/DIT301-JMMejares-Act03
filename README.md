A new Flutter project.

# Project Reflections

## 1. What design choices did you make (colors, font, layout)?

- **Colors:** I opted for a minimalist color palette primarily using blue and white. This choice was made to create a clean, modern, and timeless aesthetic. The high contrast between black and white also enhances readability and reduces visual clutter.
- **Font:** The default Flutter font was used for this project. It is a sans-serif font, which is generally considered easy to read on digital screens.
- **Layout:** The layout is centered and spacious to ensure that all elements are easy to see and interact with. I used a single-column layout to maintain a clear visual hierarchy and guide the user's focus.

## 2. How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?

- **Clear Information Hierarchy:** The layout is designed to present information in a logical and easy-to-follow manner. Key information is prominently displayed to grab the user's attention.
- **Accessibility:** By using a high-contrast color scheme (black and white), the app is more accessible to users with visual impairments. The clean layout and legible font also contribute to a better user experience for all users.

## 3. What would you improve if this were a real app?

- **Add More Features:** I would expand the app's functionality by adding more features that are relevant to the app's purpose.
- **User Testing:** I would conduct user testing to gather feedback on the app's design and usability. This would help me identify any pain points and make improvements based on real user experiences.
- **Add a brand color:** While the black and white palette is clean, adding a brand color would help establish a stronger brand identity.
- **Add animations and transitions:** Adding subtle animations and transitions would make the app feel more dynamic and engaging.
